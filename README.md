## Description

My resume webpage includes a header that has my name, picture, and navigation links that take you to the content of the page. The first section is a bio that explains a little bit about myself. Next is my work section that includes the work that I have been apart of which as of now only includes the last homework I did, the google and youtube logos are placeholders for when I get more projects under my belt. Lastly now is the contact section that include my phone number and email.
